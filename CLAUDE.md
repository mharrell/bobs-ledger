# Bob's Ledger

A real-time coaching overlay for Hearthstone Battlegrounds. It reads the game
from Hearthstone's own `Power.log`, reconstructs the board, and advises each
buy phase from a **local value function plus growth simulator over a curated
meta DB**. The live path calls **no model and no API** — `coach_llm.py` is an
optional maintainer tool for patch-note extraction, and `compare_models.py`
is a model-comparison harness. Neither is imported by `live.py`,
`live_coach.py`, `value.py` or `coach_ui.py`, and neither ships in a release.

This repository is the product, and the release zip is this tree minus the
maintainer-only parts (`analysis/`, `telemetry/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`ROADMAP.md`, the LLM tools and the caches).

## Layout

**The code lives in `app/`, not at the root.** The root keeps the launcher,
`README.md`, `LICENSE` and `docs/`, so someone who unzips a release sees the
thing to click and the documents — and nothing else. The zip mirrors the repo
(it walks the working tree), with `VERSION` and `.update_state.json` written at
the zip ROOT: that directory is what `update.py` resolves as the install root,
one level above the code.

- Suite: `python -m unittest discover -s app/tests` (from the repo root).
- `app/meta/`, `app/img_cache/`, `app/decision_logs/`, `app/patch_reports/`:
  the code derives all of these from its own directory, so they moved with it.
- `analysis/` (research notes, some naming real opponents) and `telemetry/`
  (the release channel itself) stay at the root and never ship. Maintainer
  tools that read `analysis/` therefore resolve `dirname(_HERE)/analysis` —
  deriving it from `_HERE` alone silently turned the patch-coverage gate into
  a no-op.
- Installs from before the move are reshaped on update by
  `update.py::migrate_flat_layout`: local data moves into `app/`, the old loose
  files are removed, and anything unrecognised at the root is left alone.

## Worktree discipline

- Code work happens in git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`. **Main is the
  only truth; origin is backup. If it's not in main, it's not done.**
- Every session that touched code ends with `python app/sync.py` (commit + merge
  into main + push) — or ends by explicitly reporting "branch X, N commits,
  NOT merged".
- Branch from FRESH main. Starting from a stale base is how the same bug got
  fixed twice on two branches.
- After a merge, delete the remote branch too.

## Never break these

- **Privacy.** `sanitize_log.py` redacts every identity in a shared log
  (BattleTags, bare opponent handles, account ids); `privacy_scan.py` is the
  independent verifier; `publish_release.py` refuses to publish if any shipped
  text file carries personal data. Do not weaken the redactor, do not make the
  verifier share its patterns, and do not add a real handle to a fixture
  (use the documented placeholders).
- **The update join.** `VERSION` + `.update_state.json` are stamped into each
  release and are what let a zip install be told a newer release exists.
  `update.py::_install_root` prefers whichever directory holds a `VERSION`, so
  the code can sit one level below the stamps (the `app/` layout) without the
  extraction landing in the wrong place.
- **The two publish gates.** They have deliberate overrides; using one should
  be a decision, never a convenience.
- **Consent gates the only outbound player data.** `share.py` sends nothing
  until the stored answer is yes, refuses a report its own verifier rejects,
  and never raises into the coach. `session_report.py`'s whitelist `SPEC` IS
  the privacy control: a field it does not name cannot appear, so adding a
  field to the report means adding it to the spec on purpose.
- **`privacy_scan` cannot see a JSON name field.** It matches the shapes the
  log writes (`PlayerName=`, `Entity=`, `GameAccountId=`) and a handle under
  a key called `"name"` matches none of them. The opponent's handle rides in
  `analysis.opp_comp.name` — one real session carried 50 — which is why a
  bundle of raw decisions could pass "verified clean" while carrying one.
  Strip by name; do not lean on the scan for that category.

## Domain facts that keep biting (log ground truth)

- **Minions cost a FLAT 3 gold, all tiers.** Their `tag=479` COST tags are
  stale legacy tier costs and must not be trusted; `value._buy_prices` is the
  one price layer. Tavern spells keep their own prices.
- **Tavern upgrade prices are dynamic**: start at (target+3) gold, drop 1 per
  round waited — read the live button cost, never compute it.
- **The per-game ban list is provably NOT in the log** (identical CREATE_GAME
  across different-ban games). The 5/5 inference is pool-statistical, and the
  overlay's manual ban picker (`POST /bans`) supplies exact bans.
- **Casting a spell from HAND is free** — only the tavern BUY charges.
- **Combat-phase stat gains are non-persistent**, so combat-only buff-givers
  are `W_COMBAT_SCALE` power, not growth engines.
- Card ids drift across patches; identity matching prefers names for trinkets
  and heroes, ids for minions.

## Tool map (see DESIGN.md for the full list)

Live path: `live.py` (monitor + overlay server) → `live_coach.py` (incremental
analysis) → `value.py` (value function, top move) → `coach_ui.py` (overlay).
Support: `board_state.py`, `bans.py`, `pool.py`, `lobby.py`, `choices.py`,
`simulate_growth.py`, `meta.py`, `tribes.py`, `config.py`.

Maintainer: `doctor.py` (one-shot pre-flight verdict — start here),
`patch_day.py`, `logquery.py`, `review_kit.py`, `replay_review.py`,
`comp_miner.py`, `pool_roster.py`, `check_meta.py`, `check_patch_db.py`,
`privacy_scan.py`. Every entry point is bounded to a few lines and takes
`--json`: output tokens are the expensive side.

## Release & first run

`python app/publish_release.py --note "..."` builds the zip, runs both gates, and
PUTs it plus the manifest to the collector's KV namespace (the collector lives
in `telemetry/`, deployed at `bobs-ledger.workers.dev`; the same URL serves
every release, so installed copies keep updating). `--dry-run` runs the gates
without uploading.

Applies are atomic: `apply_zip` stages the release in `.staging`, verifies it
against the zip, then moves each file into place with the copies it replaces
set aside — so an interrupted update rolls back instead of leaving an install
that is part old and part new. Both launchers restore `.staging/old` before the
program check (a killed commit can leave `app/live.py` missing, and telling a
player to re-extract the zip is useless); `update.recover()`, or
`update.py --recover`, then finishes precisely — including removing files the
new version added — while `APPLIED` on disk means "do not undo this".

## Where the last session left off (2026-10-04, main 6bcfbcc)

Sharing sends ONE REPORT PER GAME now, and that much is proven in the field:
three games produced three reports in the install's `app\session_reports\`,
each with `games: 1` (147, 147 and 128 advisories), 85 opponent handles stripped
by the whitelist before anything left the machine, and all three arrived in
Cloudflare under `sessions/<date>/<id>.json.gz`. The install-level check that was
outstanding is DONE; do not redo it.

THREE THINGS TO DO NEXT, in this order.

1. A MEASURED BUG, and the design reason behind its fix. The game-end trigger
   (the `_LAST_SHARE_ATTEMPT` block in `live.py`'s monitor) fires the instant
   the log says the game ended, while the coach is still recording that game's
   last advisories. Cloud copy against local copy:

       451ada39fa79745b   cloud  1557 b   14 advisories  11:42:06
                          local 11338 b  128 advisories  11:57:39

   The exit backstop then rebuilt the same game with everything known, and the
   collector refused it (409: same id, different bytes). The cloud keeps the
   first sixth of that game for good. The trigger has to wait for a game's data
   to settle — a short idle delay after the end — so the FIRST send is the
   complete one and the backstop finds nothing left to do.

2. `.sent.json` does not list `451ada39fa79745b` even though its POST arrived,
   so "was this sent?" cannot be trusted. Fix with (1), since the settle delay
   decides when that file is written.

3. A smoke test that runs `monitor()` for one tick and fails on any exception.
   Overdue three times now. Two published builds (5ce8f58, 5b7e83c) crashed on
   startup with `NameError: name 'opts' is not defined` because `monitor(path,
   poll)` never received the parsed flags while two of its call sites passed
   `opts`; 1229 tests passed through both because nothing in the suite ever
   called `monitor()`. To reproduce by hand:
   `python app\live.py --no-ui --no-share` against a settled session.

Smaller open items: the Cloudflare read key (`HEARTH_TELEMETRY_KEY`) is not in
`telemetry\.dev.vars`, so the KV listing needs the dashboard; and the KV
namespace also holds every `release/…` zip, so filter by the `sessions/` prefix
rather than scanning. The dashboard download names files
`sessions_<date>_<id>.json.gz`, and the values are gzip, which is correct.

The `readme-rewrite` branch is still on origin, unmerged and now identical to
`main`, kept only so a non-technical tester's link keeps working.

Users start with `Start Bob's Ledger.cmd` at the zip root: it finds Python,
asks before installing `requests`, and **offers to turn Hearthstone's file
logging on** — `setup_logging.py` edits the game's own `log.config` in place
(backing it up first and touching only the two keys the coach needs, because
that file has five other sections that a Deck Tracker user depends on), then
offers a Desktop shortcut wearing `app/bobs-ledger.ico`, and runs
`app\live.py --open`. Windows
draws no icon on a `.cmd`, so the shortcut is the only clickable thing that can wear
one — and it must be created on the user's machine, since a `.lnk` embeds
absolute paths.

`Start Bob's Ledger.command` is the macOS twin, kept in step by hand. It is
**unverified**: no Mac has run it, and the packaging machine has no bash to
even parse it. Platform branches live in `config.py` (client root, launcher
names, both `Power.log` shapes) and `setup_logging.py` (`log.config` under
`~/Library/Preferences` on macOS; a `pgrep` probe instead of `tasklist`).
Dependencies go into a `.venv` rather than `--user`, because Homebrew's Python
refuses system-wide installs (PEP 668) — and the Windows launcher already
prefers a venv, so both use the same one.

## Hazards worth remembering

- `publish_release.py` walks the WORKING TREE, not git: an untracked scratch
  directory once inflated a release from 236 entries to 472. The
  reproducibility gate catches it; do not paper over it with `--allow-dirty`.
- `scrape_comps.py --diff` REPORTS but still WRITES — `--dry-run` is the flag
  that does not. `refresh_trinkets.py` writes by default for the same reason.
- `python-hslog/` is vendored and TRACKED (upstream's tests are not, because
  their fixtures carry third-party BattleTags). `parse_bg.py` is the only
  tool that needs it; `extract_game.py` is stdlib-only.
- Hearthstone logs live at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone\Logs\...`;
  Hearthstone ROTATES them, so a measurement quoting a session dir may not be
  re-derivable later.
- Real logs carry real people's handles. Local `decision_logs/` and
  `Power.log`s hold everything by design and never leave the machine except
  through the sanitized corpus path.
